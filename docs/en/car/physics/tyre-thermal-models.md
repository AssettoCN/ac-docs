title: Cars – Tyre Thermal Models
---

A completely new, physically-based thermal model featuring rim temp, sidewall temps, and multilayer tread/carcass temps. It also includes physical tire wear. Much more computationally expensive than V1/2 models.

Please find debug/visualization page in Car Debug app.

Strongly recommended to use maxwell hysteretic damping (see code in Tyre Physics) in conjunction with this model.

This model is designed to be fairly plug and play, and as such should function without explicitly including most of its parameters (as they are set to reasonable defaults). If you cannot tell what a parameter means based on its description, it is recommended to not change it.

NOTE: This model is very much still a work in progress and **will** change, please keep that in mind if using it in your projects.

### Example Implementation (`tyres.ini`)
