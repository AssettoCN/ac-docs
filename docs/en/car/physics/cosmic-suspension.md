title: Cars – COSMIC Suspension
---


Fully supported in CSP v0.20+

COSMIC allows explicit creation of joints and bodies to produce desired suspension types, versus the preset types in vanilla AC (DWB, STRUT, AXLE, ML), while also avoiding the type-specific bugs in AC's presets (STRUT has many issues, ML hardly works, etc).

Note: only recommended for adept physics developers - cosmic removes many development boundaries, but this means it is quite easy to overstep them (and e.g. cause the game to crash). Additionally, Assetto Corsa's (relatively low) default physics rate means that certain suspension types will not function well. The more complicated and stiff the linkage, the more difficulty the Open Dynamics Engine physics solver will have. Visit the CSP Discord for development support or to make documentation suggestions.

Damage works the same as in vanilla AC (for now), and ARBs can use vanilla or cphys code (see general Suspension docs).

> **Known Bugs:**
>
>**0.1.79**
> * Slider joint is broken. Fixed for 0.2.
> * "Simple" damper values do not work on coilovers. Fixed for 0.2.
> * Coilovers require DAMPER_LUTS and dampers.ini. Fixed for 0.2 via allowing above option.
> * FLIP_PRELOAD accidentally defaults to 1. Set FLIP_PRELOAD=0 for normal behavior. Will default to 0 for 0.2.
> * Damper luts potentially broken. Good on 0.2.
> * "Strut" steer axis issue. Fixed for 0.2
> * Rim offset not working. Working in 0.2, see docs for functionality (different to KS).
> * Whole world of a mess with damper/spring setup options. All sorted on 0.2.
>
>**0.2.0**
> * Preload broken on coilovers using spring luts. Fixed for 0.2.1
> * ENGINE_TORQUE_BODY not working 100% correctly when using TORQUE_MODE_EX=2 (one function still applying torque to the wrong body). Fixed with 0.2.1
>
>**Current**
> * Preload broken on torsion bars, use PRELOAD_TORQUE instead. Will be fixed for 0.2.5

Example implementation (note: may not load in-game if copy and pasted directly, as the geometry coordinates were blindly altered, it is simply to show the parameters):

TOE_OUT=0.0004, 0.0004          ;same as KS, but as of 0.3.0, most values can have different defaults for left and right. Use comma separated values to indicate L, R

BODY_0_MIRROR=1                 ;0 to disable mirroring to the other side of the car laterally, default 0

BODY_1_NAME=T_BAR
BODY_1_MASS=0.1                 ;mass doesn't necessarily have to match real component, sometimes it's better to have lighter/heavier parts for solver stability. If the part is unsprung, it is good practice to remove it from HUB_MASS in the proportion that makes sense (e.g. a wishbone would have approximately 50% of its mass removed from HUB_MASS. This is done to ensure that the unsprung mass of the car stays accurate to the desired value)
BODY_1_INERTIA=0.0, 0.0, 0.0
BODY_1_POS=0.8, 0.2, 0.4

;ENGINE_TORQUE_BODY=CHASSIS2    ; this line tells the solver which body that reaction torque from the engine/wheels should get applied to. Useful and necessary for live axle designs, etc.

HJ0_BODY_B=ROCKER               ;if BODY_A is not listed, it is assumed to be CHASSIS, and if BODY_B is not listed, it is assumed to be HUB_L. This is true for all joint types. HUB_R also available, L is default.

HJ0_POS_B=0.6, 0.1, 1
HJ0_PARITY=-1                       ;-1 means mirrored left and right, 0 means left only, 1 means right only, default -1

;important note about body assignment:
;if you list the same name for Body A and Body B, the code will assume you are connecting the left and right side's mirrored bodies (if available). If, for example, you have a heave spring that connects to the rocker arm on each side, you simply put _BODY_A=ROCKER and _BODY_B=ROCKER, and it will make the connection without further intervention. This applies to joints/springs/dampers/coilovers/etc.

### General Tips

* Take advantage of the default values! Cosmic suspension files can get very long very quickly, but many of the parameters are fine left to their defaults, which can shorten the file significantly.

* All rates, forces, et cetera are at the component level. Meaning no more wheel rates, spring rates are the rates of the springs themselves, same for dampers and their crossover velocities.

* Be mindful of movement constraints when "designing" a cosmic suspension. Ball joints only constrain translation, so rotation must be controlled by something else (another ball joint limits the rotation to only 1 axis, and another limits relative movement entirely). Distance joints are just two ball joints that are connected, so the same principles apply. Hinges are essentially just two ball joints as well (but with a memory framework that stores the axis and angle, etc).

* If doing geometry that has the spring/damper connecting to one of the control arms (e.g. most DWB designs), the correct approach is to create a rigid body at the CoG of the control arm (a fair approximation is the weighted average of the 3 corner coordinates - weight the hub point as 2 and the chassis points as 1) and then connect that body to the chassis and hub via ball joints. This is only needed if something needs to be attached to the control arm. If not, it can just be made from distance joints.

* Strut suspension can be made with a slider joint, a rigid body, and a ball joint. The ball joint attaches the strut top (body) to the chassis, and the slider joint attaches the hub to the strut top.

#### Joint types

- `BALL`: connection via freely spinning socket ensuring constant distance between objects:

- `SLIDER`: basic slider connection:

- `DISTANCE`: connection ensuring distance between points:

- `HINGE`: connection ensuring only 1DoF around provided axis:
