title: Cars – Instruments inputs
---

With **v0.1.25-preview183**, a better way of setting up instruments was created. The idea is to have a single list of inputs available for digital and analog instruments (including conditional text), animations and even emissives (with optional threshold for toggling and possibility to switch to analog mode).

Existing code for old extended instruments was rewritten to avoid having three separate systems running, but I tried to keep things compatible. Still, if you would notice anything breaking, please let me know.

### Syntax

In order to keep things compatible, the way to pick an input might vary for different cases. For example:

Note: "..." stands for INPUT type
```ini
; ANALOG INSTRUMENTS
; New approach:
[ANALOG_INDICATOR_...]
INPUT = AMBIENT_TEMP

; Old-style approach (only works for hours, minutes and seconds to keep clocks working):
[HOUR_INDICATOR]
...

; DIGITAL INSTRUMENTS
; The way to set it via digital_instruments.ini 
[ITEM_0]
TYPE_EXT = DRIFT_POINTS

; Old-style approach (works with any input):
[DI_DRIFT_POINTS]
DIGITAL_ITEM = 0

; DIGITAL INSTRUMENTS (CONDITION)
; The way to set it via digital_instruments.ini 
[ITEM_0]
TYPE_EXT = CONDITION_TEXT
INPUT = TURBO_WASTEGATE

; CUSTOM ANIMATIONS
; New approach
[ANIMATION_...]
INPUT = LOWBEAM

; Old-style approach (works with any input):
[ANIMATION_...]
BIND_TO_EXTRA_A = 1

; EMISSIVES
; New approach
[EMISSIVE_...]
INPUT = BODY_DAMAGE

; Old-style approach (works with any input):
[EMISSIVE_LIGHT]
...

...
```

### Input parameters

With all those types of inputs, as you can see, you have a section defining the thing. That’s where you can configure input in almost any way you might need.

```ini
[ANIMATION_...]
INPUT = TYRE_PRESSURE
INPUT_SELECTOR = THIRD

INPUT_ADD = 0.0
INPUT_MULT = 1.0
INPUT_MIN = 10.0
INPUT_MAX = 40.0
INPUT_MOD = 5.0
INPUT_LUT = (| 0=0 | 10=20 |)

INPUT_LAG_UP = 0.9
INPUT_LAG_DOWN = 0.95

INPUT_ROUND = 2.0
INPUT_ROUND_MODE = FLOORING

INPUT_STALLED_VALUE = 7.5
INPUT_STALLED_LAG = 0.85

[EMISSIVE_...]
INPUT = BODY_DAMAGE
INPUT_THRESHOLD = 20
INPUT_THRESHOLD_INVERSE = 1
INPUT_DEBUG = 30
```

- `INPUT`: defines type of input, but in some cases, the way to define type might be different. Look at “Syntax” section for mode details.
- `INPUT_SELECTOR`: sets how to deal with several values (for example, both tyre pressure and body damage have four values, for each wheel and for each side). Possible values:
  - `MIN` (alias: `MINIMUM`): pick minimum value;
  - `MAX` (alias: `MAXIMUM`): pick maximum value;
  - `SUM` (alias: `TOTAL`): add up values together;
  - `MULT` (alias: `MULTIPLIED`): multiply values;
  - `AVG` (alias: `AVERAGE`): sum values and divide them by number of values;
  - `LEN` (alias: `LENGTH`): calculate square root of sum of squares (for example, for finding total G-force);
  - `X` (alias: `FIRST`): get first value from the series;
  - `Y` (alias: `SECOND`): get second value from the series;
  - `Z` (alias: `THIRD`): get third value from the series;
  - `W` (alias: `FOURTH`): get fourth value from the series;
  - any number `N`: get Nth value.
- `INPUT_MULT`: multiply value by X;
- `INPUT_ADD`: add X to value;
- `INPUT_MIN`, `INPUT_MAX`: if any of those values are set, original number will be clamped within those bounds, default values are —∞/+∞;
- `INPUT_MOD`: if greater than zero, module from division by that value will be taken instead, before going through look-up table (but after going through min/max check);
- `INPUT_LUT`: optional look-up table allowing to set things like scale or offset as well as something more complex, uses linear interpolation;
- `INPUT_LAG_UP`, `INPUT_LAG_DOWN`: optional smoothment for changing value, applied after LUT. First one is used if actual number is higher than smoothed one, second is for moments when original number is smaller than smoothed one;
- `INPUT_ROUND`: optional rounding to that number (for example, if you want one digit after dot, use `INPUT_ROUND = 0.1`);
- `INPUT_ROUND_MODE`: mode for rounding, could be either:
  - `FLOOR` (alias: `FLOORING`): drop rounded part;
  - `ROUND` (alias: `ROUNDING`): regular rules, go to next step if rounded part is equal or higher than half of `INPUT_ROUND`;
  - `CEIL` (alias: `CEILING`): always go to the next step if any part to be rounded is present;
- `INPUT_STALLED_VALUE`: optional replacement for original number for stalled engine, runs after min/max check, but before optional module division and LUT;
- `INPUT_STALLED_LAG`: if forced stalled value is set, this number would define how smooth is transition;
- `INPUT_THRESHOLD`: emissives in their default mode can be either on or off, this option sets threshold for that switch;  
  If you need to specify the range instead, use:
  - `INPUT_THRESHOLD_LOWER` and `INPUT_THRESHOLD_UPPER`: work as A < x < B, excluding A and B;
  - `INPUT_THRESHOLD_LOWER_INC` and `INPUT_THRESHOLD_UPPER_INC`: work as A ≤ x ≤ B, including A and B;
- `INPUT_THRESHOLD_INVERSE`: if set to `0` (for false), emissive would turn on if value is below threshold;
- `INPUT_DEBUG`: easy way to test things, especially for analog instruments — it replaces original value with something else (basically by overriding min/max values as the ones applied first anyway).

In most cases, you don’t need to set those values, patch has some defaults, but it might be useful for some cases.

### Format

To use certain types of inputs, like the ones returning lap times, properly for digital displays, some formatting is necessary. Such types usually have it set by default, but you can override that behaviour, or make regular input formatted. More information is available [here](/en/car/instruments/digital-instruments).

### More complex expressions

With CSP 0.1.77 it is now possible to have inputs referring to other inputs and using expressions. First of all, to refer to another input you can create new shared inputs:

```ini
[SHARED_INPUT_...]
NAME = my_input  ; name to refer to it with
INPUT = GAS
; all of regular INPUT parameters are available here
```

And to use it later, or just use a complex expression:

```ini
[EMISSIVE_...]
INPUT = 'calc:max(my_input * GAS, BRAKE)'
```

Of course, shared inputs can refer to other shared inputs as well:

```ini
[SHARED_INPUT_...]
NAME = my_other_input
INPUT = 'calc:pow(my_input, 20) + WIND_SPEED'
```

Available functions:

- No arguments (constants):
  - `e`: euler number;
  - `pi`: pi.
- One argument:
  - `abs(x)`: returns absolute value of `x`;
  - `acos(x)`: returns angle in radians;
  - `asin(x)`: returns angle in radians;
  - `atan(x)`: returns angle in radians;
  - `ceil(x)`: rounds up;
  - `cos(x)`: takes angle in radians;
  - `cosh(x)`: takes angle in radians;
  - `exp(x)`: returns `e^x`;
  - `floor(x)`: rounds down;
  - `ln(x)`: natural log;
  - `log(x)`: log of 10;
  - `log10(x)`: log of 10;
  - `saturate(x)`: returns `x` if it’s between 0 and 1, otherwise returns 0 or 1, whatever is closer;
  - `sign(x)`: returns sign of `x` unless it’s 0, otherwise returns 0;
  - `sin(x)`: takes angle in radians;
  - `sinh(x)`: takes angle in radians;

  - `smootherstep(x)`: like smoothstep, but even smoother;
  - `sqrt(x)`: returns square root;
  - `tan(x)`: takes angle in radians;
  - `tanh(x)`: takes angle in radians.
- Two arguments:
  - `atan2(x, y)`: turns `x` and `y` into an angle in radians;
  - `max(x, y)`: returns biggest of `x` and `y`;
  - `min(x, y)`: returns smallest of `x` and `y`;
  - `pow(x, y)`: raises `x` in `y` power;
  - `step(x, y)`: if `y` is greater or equal to `x`, returns 1, otherwise returns 0.
- More arguments:
  - `clamp(x, min, max)`: returns `x` if it’s between `min` and `max`, otherwise returns `min` or `max`, whatever is closer;
  - `remap(x, a, b, c, d)`: if `x` equals `a`, returns `c`, if it’s `b`, returns `d`, otherwise linearly interpolates between `c` and `d` (without clamping).
